# Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning - Project 1

## Project Summary

For this project, I used a Deep Q-Network to train the agent whose task was to collect yellow bananas and avoid blue ones. A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.

## DQN Model

In this case, I wanted to see how changing the number of neurons in the hidden layer would affect the model. So I trained two models of four layers, one with 64 neurons in the hidden layer and one with 128 neurons.
